# Is Gus Visiting Island
This mod allows you to know whether Gus will visiting Ginger Island that day by calling him on the phone. It relies on **Content Patcher**, so be sure to have it insalled before using this mod.

This mod consists of 2 parts: the folder without \[CP\] prefix provides a token for Content Patcher to identify whether Gus is on Ginger Island, and the other folder with that prefix changes Gus's dialogue on the phone.

**How to use it**: download the "Is-Gus-Visiting-Island" folder, copy and paste it into the **Mods** folder of Stardew Valley. For more information, check the [official wiki page](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Getting_Started)
